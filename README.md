# Enterprise Accessible
Enterprise Accessibility Conformance Ontology was developed from an analysis of question data that was collected from users and subject matter experts throughout the enterprise. The WCAG 2.0 and WAI-ARIA classes are from the [Accessible Ontology Version 5.1](ftp://ftp.iti.gr/pub/incoming/AccessibleOntologyVersion5.1.zip) created by the [Accessible EU Project](http://www.accessible-eu.org/index.php/ontology.html). These classes were injected throughout the Enterprise Accessibility Conformance Ontology according to the Enterprise's Accessibility Conformance processes for design, development,  test, and reporting.
